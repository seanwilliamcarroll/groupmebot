# groupmebot

My lame attempt at building a groupmebot

Current usage:
  Create a file 'config.py' with two variables: bot_id and group (see gen_config.py for a template). Set these to the group number of your bot and the bot id as a string, as is done in the template. Simply modifying gen_config.py will work as well, but less fun.
